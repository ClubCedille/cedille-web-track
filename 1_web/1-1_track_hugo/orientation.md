# 1. Orientation

Welcome to your web development journey with **Hugo**, a modern static site generator. Before diving into tools and code, this orientation will give you essential context — what a static site is, how it compares to dynamic sites, where it’s used in the real world, and what you'll gain from this tutorial.

## 1.1 What is a Static Site?

A **static site** is a website that consists of fixed files — typically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — that are delivered directly to the user’s browser without any server-side processing. Each page exists as a physical file.

- No databases
- No backend scripting (like PHP, Python, Node.js)
- Lightning-fast loading
- Easier hosting (can live anywhere, even GitHub Pages)

Think of it as a ready-made book: every page is already printed and bound.

## 1.2 Static vs Dynamic

| Feature              | Static Site                          | Dynamic Site                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Content Generation   | Pre-built (during site build)        | On-the-fly (during each user request)       |
| Technologies         | HTML, CSS, JS                        | Server-side + client-side (PHP, Python, etc)|
| Performance          | Very fast                            | Depends on server/database performance       |
| Complexity           | Simpler                              | More complex, especially with user data      |
| Hosting Requirements | Minimal (even free)                  | Requires a server or platform backend        |

**Key idea**: Static sites are perfect when content doesn’t change per user (e.g. portfolios, blogs, documentation).

## 1.3 Real-World Use Cases

Static sites are used more often than you might think. Here are real examples:

- **Personal Portfolios** – Devs, designers, and writers showcase their work.
- **Blogs & Content Sites** – Fast and SEO-friendly (e.g. Tech blogs, cooking sites).
- **Documentation** – Many open-source projects (like Kubernetes or React) use static generators for their docs.
- **Landing Pages** – For startups, product launches, or campaigns.
- **Company Websites** – When no user interactivity is needed.

You can even make hybrid sites where most pages are static, but a few dynamic elements (like comments or contact forms) are embedded via third-party services.

## 1.4 Purpose of This Tutorial

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand what makes a static site and why tools like Hugo exist
- Be able to write and manage content in Markdown
- Build and customize a complete personal portfolio using Hugo
- Deploy that site live on the internet via GitHub Pages — no server or paid hosting needed

This guide is beginner-friendly and assumes **zero experience** with web development. You’ll learn by doing, with labs and projects to help you apply each concept.
